  * Initial upload (closes: #193256)
    [ Note: this package belongs to source package awe in woody and it has
      been remove from sid in 2002. Beside vkeybd the awe source package in woody
      provides also packages holding kernel drivers for Sound Blaster AWE32. After
      these drivers have been included in the Linux kernel the upstream splitted
      the code and changed the versioning of vkeybd, thus I'm using epoch ]
